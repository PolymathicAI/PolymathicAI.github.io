blurb: 
shortblurb: We present a self-supervised learning strategy that bridges diverse observational modalities in astrophysics. By aligning cross-modal representations of galaxies in a shared embedding space, we are able to perform accurate cross-modal look-up as well as competitive zero- and few-shot predictions on downstream tasks.

One of the main goals of our initiative is to create systems that connect knowledge across the conventional boundaries of science. Indeed, in a wide variety of physical domains, there exist multiple disjoint ways of measuring the same underlying systems, and so far machine learning solutions have been specialized to particular types of measurement. Therefore, developing methods that can extract information from diverse observations and represent it in a shared embedding space is an  exciting avenue of exploration to unify observational modalities.  

A particularly important area in science in which to deploy cross-modal connections is in large-scale, astronomical galaxy surveys. The current generation of these surveys contains between ten of millions to billions of galaxies, and different telescopes and instruments give us access to different kinds of observations. In particular in this work, we consider imaging surveys, which give us color images of galaxies, and spectroscopic surveys, which instead of images, measure optical spectra of galaxies  (i.e. a quantitative measure of the light from the galaxy as a function of wavelength). Both types of observations are complementary; they give us different information about these galaxies.
